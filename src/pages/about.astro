            ... would be my professional summary if I were to write one. Quite
            frankly, I really don't want to write one here so lemme just say
            that "I code, that's it really."

            In general, I have alot of games that I play. It's hard to list them
            all here so I'll just list the ones that I play the most. Most of them
            are gacha games anyways so feel free to, uh, add me or something.

        <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">About politics and other stuff</h2>
        <div class="prose prose-neutral mb-4 dark:prose-invert">
          <p>
            I tend to stay away and hold myself from politics and other
            controversial topics. I'm not a fan of them and I don't want to be
            involved in any of that, normally.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm a firm believer in the idea that everyone has their own opinions
            and beliefs and that they should be respected. I don't want to
            impose my beliefs on others and I expect the same from others. Tho,
            if for some reason you force me to talk about politics, I'll warn
            you that I'm not the best person to talk to about it.
          </p>
          <p>You really don't want to hear me talk about politics, trust me.</p>

            need a full blown shiny backend for a personal website?
