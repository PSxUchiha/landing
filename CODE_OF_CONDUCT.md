# Code of Virtue

## Purpose

The founders and all current developers of this project, at the time when this document was composed, have pledged to govern their interactions with each other, with clients, and with the larger user community in accordance with Islamic principles of conduct derived from the Qur'an and Sunnah. This ethical framework has proven its value across diverse communities for over a thousand years, and has served as a foundation for personal and professional excellence throughout Islamic history.

### Scope of Application

No one is required to follow The Way, to know Islamic teachings, or even to think that these principles are beneficial. The founders of this project believe that anyone who follows these ethical guidelines will lead a more harmonious and productive life, but individuals are free to disagree or choose different paths if they wish.

The founders and all current developers have pledged to follow the spirit of The Way to the best of their ability. They view these principles as their promise to all users of how the developers are expected to behave. This is a unilateral commitment, or "ahd" (covenant). In other words, the developers are saying: "We will treat you with respect, integrity, and fairness regardless of how you treat us."

This commitment reflects the Islamic principle of ihsan (excellence and benevolence) which encourages doing what is good and beneficial even when not obligated or reciprocated. Our conduct is guided by our values rather than conditional upon the behavior of others.

## The Way
